# react-moment-usage
A react application with moment date related library
To use Moment.js in a React project, you'll first need to install the Moment.js library via npm or yarn. Here are the steps:

### Installation:

If you're using npm:

```bash
npm install moment
```

If you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn add moment
```

### Usage in React Components:

Once you've installed Moment.js, you can use it in your React components by importing it:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import moment from 'moment';

const MyComponent = () => {
  // Use Moment.js to handle dates and times
  const currentDate = moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD'); // Example: Get current date in YYYY-MM-DD format

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Today's Date</h1>
      <p>{currentDate}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, `moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD')` fetches the current date and formats it in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format using Moment.js.

You can utilize other features provided by Moment.js, such as parsing, formatting, manipulating, and working with dates and times according to your application requirements.

Remember that Moment.js, while widely used, is in maintenance mode, and its maintainers recommend using native JavaScript date manipulation functions (or modern date libraries like Luxon or date-fns) for new projects. If you're starting a new project, consider alternatives like Luxon or date-fns, which offer similar functionalities with modern design and smaller bundle sizes.
